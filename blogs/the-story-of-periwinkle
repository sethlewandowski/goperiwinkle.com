        <h1>The Story of Periwinkle</h1>
        <p class="bold">by: Jordo Evans</p>
        <h4>The Story of Periwinkle is truly one of a kind.</h4>
        <p>You’ll really wanna hear this, I’ll tell it to you in a rhyme.<br>
          Now Seth and I were eager. I should say eager-beaver.<br>
          Entrepreneurs at heart, we can’t live, we can’t breath or<br>
          Stomach the idea of always being an employee. <br>
          We would rather get an attorney. Pull-off some insurance fraud-and live off the money.<br>
          Don’t worry. That’s a joke. I Intended it to be funny.<br>
          Anyway, back to the point. I am trying to paint a picture. <br>
          We are the type of guys who’ve always dreamed of something bigger. <br>
          And dream we did. Every morning on a call. <br>
          Seth in San Fran, I in Tulsa. We didn’t stall.<br>
          Ideas kept coming. They were flowing. Milk and honey.<br> 
          Side note: The best part about ideas is, they didn’t cost us any money.<br> 
        </p>
          <h4>Enter Cole Johnson, an old high school friend.</h4>
        <p>
          He went to college, worked hard, played sticks and got the short end.<br> 
          He was laid-off by his employer due to budget cuts.<br>
          So Cole was left wondering “Okay, now what?”<br>
          Word travels fast and it caught my attention.<br>
          The problem wasn’t Cole. It was economic recession. <br>
          “Seth, our friend Cole was laid off and unexpectedly. What can we do to help him? <br>
          He isn’t having any luck and he--”. <br>
          Seth interrupted me. He said, “Maybe we should start a company.” <br>
          A company… I had no reluctancy. <br>
          In fact, if I recall correctly, I jumped with glee.<br>
          A company could be the answer. <br>
          It was, luckily.<br>
        </p>
          <h4>So off we go, we scrambled up as much cash as we could muster.</h4>
        <p>
          $1,600. Humble beginnings, but it was more than enough, Sir. <br>
          To start a business in a nation that is truly great.<br>
          We have the freedom to build our dreams in the United States.<br>
          After a year of garages, we needed to change our name. <br>
          The name we had was boring. Do you remember it? “It was lame.”<br>
          Back to the drawing board for a name that could outlast us.<br>
          We asked people what they thought about “Periwinkle”. It was disastrous.<br>
          I kid you not, every single person laughed at us. <br>
          Garage cleaning? Periwinkle? That is preposterous.<br>
          Though we did appreciate everyone being honest with us.<br>
          Yes, it’s a crazy name. That’s why it dawned on us. <br>
        </p>
          <h4>We went all in with Periwinkle. We changed our name over night.</h4>
        <p>
          Our name is anything but plain and simple. Just the way we like. <br>
          Periwinkle perfectly provides customers with a promise.<br>
          We promise exceptional customer experience. Honest! <br>
          We built our business from the ground up around this purpose.<br>
          We don’t just clean garages, we provide a trust-worthy servie. <br>
          We are smashing the competition. No contest.<br>
          So next time you stand in your garage and sigh with stress.<br>
          Behold the sight of the mess, the dust that seems to caress.<br>
          All the junk in your “garage”, home-sweet-home for pests.<br>
          Yes mice, sometimes rats, but count on a spiders nest.<br>
          I must confess, owning a business has been quite the test.<br>
          But our persistence is a testament to our relentlessness.<br>
          Be our guest and question this. Witness how our energy is infectious.<br>
          You know the saying: “Cleanliness is next to Godliness”?<br>
          In confidence, we predict a global service dominance.<br>
          Your garage depends on Periwinkle’s competence.<br>
          It’s common sense, that we’ve developed quite the tolerance for a mess.<br>
          Every homeowner deserves a garage that they can digest.<br>
          Sorry for getting off track there for a bit. I digress.<br>
          Where was I? Oh yeah.<br>
          Next time you stand in your garage and sigh with stress.<br>
          Pick up the phone, dial us, and take a deep breath. <br>
        </p>
          <h4>Now let me tell you about how we got the word out.</h4>
        <p>
          It wasn’t cold calls, billboards, or card stock handouts. <br>
          Believe it or not, our company was in the local paper.<br>
          The Tulsa World proved to be a game changer. <br>
          A few months later, we were featured on the local news.<br>
          Channel 6, you made us shine. Kudos to you and the crew.<br>
          We also got on the radio and did some podcasting. <br>
          ALL of this was free, by the way… cue the gasping.<br>
          Last but not least, we managed to get on TV. <br>
          PBS, a show called Start-Up. “Look mom! I’m on TV!”<br>
          All of a sudden, Periwinkle was on everyone’s radar. <br>
          Calls from NY, California, even Canada! Need I say more?!<br>
          All this to say that we are enjoying every moment.<br>
          The best part about Periwinkle is that it’s completely ours and we own it. <br>
          But there is no better feeling than helping out a customer.<br>
          Spilled milk in your garage? That’s nothing to throw a fuss over.<br>
          Remember to treat others the way you want to be treated.<br>
          We live by that quote. It’s in our manual. Here read it. <br>
          We hope that everything we do for the world comes full-circle.<br>
          We’re exceeding expectations. Want proof? It’s in the Purple.
